# Slidely Server

## Introduction

**Server Side**it is a REST API server built with Node.js and Express and typescript, allowing users to submit and search data entries stored in a local JSON file (`db.json`). This server provides basic functionality for data submission and retrieval through a set of RESTful API endpoints.

this is a locally hosted project , however it's vercel hosting can be found here(`https://slidely-app-server.vercel.app/`) , please note only `/ping` and `/read` will work since vercel does not allow writing for serverless functions.

## Vercel or MongoDB Integration:
  the code for the vercel hosting is also given in the file in `vercel.json` which will be used in the vercel hosting(please know that vecrel will only allow reading and not the writing , so only `/ping` and `/read` will work)
   for using the mongodb as database whole script(`mongo-server.ts`) is given beside the server.ts , you just have to put your mongo db URL in place.
